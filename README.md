# Bike Types One-Hot Encoding Project

This project demonstrates **one-hot encoding** of categorical data using two approaches:  

1. **Manual encoding** (without external libraries).  
2. **Library-based encoding** using `sklearn` and `TensorFlow`.  

The dataset used is `bike_types_times.csv`, which contains a column `Road_Bike_Type` with categorical values such as `Aero`, `Climber`, and `Endurance`.
